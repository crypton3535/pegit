===============================================================================

Introduction
--------------
    Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files
over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

    A VCS allows you to:
    - revert files back to a previous state,
    - revert the entire project back to a previous state,
    - review changes made over time,
    - see who last modified something that might be causing a problem,
    - who introduced an issue and when, and more.

    Using a VCS also means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can
generally recover easily. In addition, you get all this for very little
overhead.
